## Tips:
By defualt your printer may try to shrink it a bit. Because printers hate you personally.
To stop any scaling and tell the printer you're serious this time, please manually set the scaling to **100%** or **actual** from the printer settings.

When printing, select **Save PDF** to print later.

It will automatically insert page breaks after 9 cards.
